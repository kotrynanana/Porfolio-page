                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <p>Petmade, formerly known as Pawmade, is a dog supplement brand that needed a refreshed identity to reflect its new name and stand out in a competitive market. The goal was to create a modern and minimal design that would differentiate the brand on store shelves while maintaining the trust and credibility associated with medical-grade supplements.</p>
                <p>Through extensive research and careful design decisions, the new brand identity strikes a balance between vibrant, eye-catching aesthetics and a professional, health-focused tone.</p>

        <h2>Research Overview</h2>
        <div class="research">
        <div class="description">
        <p>I conducted an in-depth analysis of around 100 pet supplement brands in the US, focusing on the most successful ones. I grouped these brands based on their approach and selling channels and noticed a clear trend: top brands like ZestyPaws or PetLab had recently rebranded, adopting bold, minimal designs.</p>
        <p>As Petmade was already undergoing a name change, it was the perfect opportunity to update all visuals. My research showed that keeping up with these design trends would make Petmade more competitive and noticeable both online and in stores. However, I proposed a more subtle approach, balancing boldness with a style that would resonate with our unique target audience.</p>
        <p>I'm including an example from some of the rebrands I analyzed to illustrate the trends that informed my design decisions.</p>

        <h2>Design Proposal</h2>
        <p>Several design directions were explored during the rebranding process. After careful consideration, this particular option was chosen:</p>

        <h2>Color Exploration & Selection</h2>
        <p>After reviewing several color schemes, we selected saffron as the primary brand color. This choice was made to introduce warmth and approachability, aligning with Petmade's identity while ensuring the brand remains distinctive and memorable.</p>

        <h2>Final Logo Design & Visual Guidelines</h2>
        <p>The final step involved refining the logo and developing a concise set of visual guidelines to ensure consistent use of the new branding. Here, I am including selected sections from the guidelines, focusing on key elements for the rebranding process, rather than the full documentation. These highlight how to properly apply the new logo and visual materials across different platforms.</p>

                <p>I created this animation to showcase how Petmade's visual identity can be extended beyond static elements, offering more dynamic and creative ways to connect with the audience and build a stronger brand presence. It also provides an example of how the brand can stand out in digital spaces, enhancing engagement with potential customers.</p>
